# GitHub Actions CI/CD Lab

This lab aims to replicate the process demonstrated in the video titled "[GitHub Actions CI/CD](https://youtu.be/mFFXuXjVgkU?feature=shared)." The objectives of this lab are as follows:

## Objectives

1. **Automation of Deployment:** Automating the deployment process is crucial for efficiency and consistency. By setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions, we can automate the deployment of our applications. This helps in reducing human errors, speeding up the release process, and ensuring that code changes are automatically deployed to production or staging environments whenever there are updates.

2. **Practical Implementation of Video Steps:** The lab aims to provide hands-on experience by practically implementing the steps outlined in the video. It's one thing to watch a tutorial, but actually following the steps and configuring GitHub Actions for CI/CD in a real project is a valuable learning experience. By doing so, we can understand the process more deeply, troubleshoot any issues that may arise, and customize the setup to fit our specific project requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this lab, follow the steps below:

1. Watch the video titled "[GitHub Actions CI/CD](https://youtu.be/mFFXuXjVgkU?feature=shared)" to understand the CI/CD process.

2. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

3. Review the configuration files for GitHub Actions in the `.github/workflows` directory.

4. Follow the comments and instructions within the configuration files to set up your CI/CD pipelines.

5. Test the CI/CD process by making changes to your project and observing the automated build and deployment.
